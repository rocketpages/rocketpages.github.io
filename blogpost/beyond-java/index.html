<p>A recent post by Mike Gualtieri of Forrester caught my attention. Mike strongly asserts that <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://blogs.forrester.com/mike_gualtieri/10-11-23-java_is_a_dead_end_for_enterprise_app_development" target="_blank">Java is a dead end for enterprises</a> and business software should be built with <em>something else</em>. Mike mentions a few different options, but mainly promotes 4GL tools such as Powerbuilder and &ldquo;all in one&rdquo; business infrastructure software such as SoftwareAG webMethods. He also touches on BPM and event processing, and by event processing I&rsquo;m pretty sure he means CEP tools such as Esper.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with Java for 10 years. I&rsquo;ve also worked briefly with FoxPro. I recently spent a few months at a client site digging through SAS code that&rsquo;s being migrated to Java. I spent almost a month on a SoftwareAG training course to learn the &ldquo;webMethods way&rdquo; of doing things. I&rsquo;ve seen 4GLs in action and I&rsquo;ve seen Java in action.</p>

<p>Is Mike really advocating the use of proprietary, niche languages such as <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebMethods_Flow" target="_blank">webMethods Flow</a> over Java? I&rsquo;m not an analyst at Forrester, but I&rsquo;ve been turning Powerpoint slides into functioning software for long enough that I feel just about qualified enough to chime in on the subject.</p>

<p>I agree with the spirit of Mike&rsquo;s post. Java can be a real pain to build typical business software with. The problem isn&rsquo;t Java itself, the problem is that businesses use it for <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>Stop me if this sounds familiar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Want yet another custom time tracking intranet site? Let&rsquo;s build it with JEE!</p>

<p>How about a utility that counts the number of ponies in our database? Hell yeah&hellip; it&rsquo;s Java time!</p>

<p>What about a UI heavy site with super-complex UX workflow? I&rsquo;ve got a fever and the only prescription is JSF, SPRING, and HIBERNATE!</p>

<h2 id="4gls-and-dead-ends:676d3bca1d69bb7c78928bbaf25861c2">4GLs and dead-ends</h2>

<p>People have tried for decades to move away from third-generation languages like Java and towards the nirvana of business folks creating their own apps with some kind of flow-charting tool. One of the first guys I worked with - he had punch cards in his drawer that <em>he</em> punched - told me all about it. It&rsquo;s the longest running punch line in IT. Mike&rsquo;s post may have been titled &ldquo;Java is a dead end&rdquo;, but it really should have been titled &ldquo;third-generation languages are a dead end&rdquo;. And the date of the article could easily have been 1980 or 1990. The dead end is not third-generation languages; languages are merely a tool.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The dead end is producing horrible software and expecting to keep up with the rest of the world.</strong></li>
<li>The dead end is promoting a stock trader or pony salesman or MBA-type to head up your IT department just because he or she really knows their way around office politics.</li>
<li>The dead end is misusing a language or technology for years and <em>blaming the technology and blaming your developers</em> rather than <em>hiring the right people to come up with your strategy and empowering your developers</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only reason these strategies worked in the past is because <strong>everyone</strong> was producing garbage software, but nothing lasts forever.</p>

<h2 id="staying-competitive:676d3bca1d69bb7c78928bbaf25861c2">Staying competitive</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a hands-on developer&rsquo;s opinion on the whole &ldquo;Java is dead&rdquo; debate.</p>

<p>Java is no more of a dead end than C, C++, or MATLAB. They all have their uses, but using Java for everything is just as poor of a strategy as trying to use MATLAB for everything.</p>

<p>If you want to build great software, you need to hire great software developers. There&rsquo;s no magic tool that will allow your business folks to put together fantastic software all by themselves. These ideas look fantastic in a Powerpoint slide or Forrester report, but fall flat in the real world.</p>

<p>How do you hire great software developers?</p>

<p><strong>Be a great team to work for.</strong> </p>

<p>Understand what&rsquo;s important to top-tier developers. Here&rsquo;s a <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html" target="_blank">good place to start</a> (this was written 10 years ago and most companies <em>still</em> aren&rsquo;t close).</p>

<p>Treat software development as a first-class citizen of your business if you&rsquo;re going to bother building software. Otherwise, stop <em>building</em> and start <em>buying</em>; find a trusted partner to build for you. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with leaning on third-party firms to focus on the technology while you focus on your core business.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a department writing software that operates like anything other than a <em>software</em> business, you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of problems that no tool in the world will ever fix. There&rsquo;s nothing worse in the world than software decisions made by companies who treat software as a necessary evil rather than a driver of growth.</p>

<p>Stop putting stock traders and accountants and lawyers in charge of your IT department. They may be smart folks, and that kind of strategy may work in politics, but it&rsquo;s painful to watch the decisions these people make day in and day out. Decisions like outsourcing a project to India with almost no oversight and wondering why it looks like a box of pudding when it finally gets delivered. Or having a budget of $100mil and not bothering to hire UX and UI professionals.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion:676d3bca1d69bb7c78928bbaf25861c2">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Developers need to speak up, while keeping in mind the limitations of the process and cultural limitations of large enterprise environments. I&rsquo;ve seen projects go completely off the rails because developers allow corporate inertia to dictate decisions rather than technical merits. I&rsquo;ve also seen money saved because someone asks the question, &ldquo;Why are we building a custom app when we can buy it off the shelf?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Java is long in the tooth, absolutely, but there&rsquo;s still so much goodness in the Java world: GWT, Wicket, Guice, and on and on. Talented programmers can create beautiful things with these tools.</p>

<p>Or if you think I&rsquo;m wrong, you can develop your next app using 4GLs like SAS, FoxPro, and webMethods.</p>
