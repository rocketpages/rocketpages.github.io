<p>Reactive applications are at the heart of a new breed of system that embraces modern infrastructure. Gone are the days of a single monolithic application running in a single data center. I believe the reactive paradigm will drive the next major innovation in how software is crafted for the web in order to meet the expectations of both end-users and organizations who are looking for ever increasing ways to secure a competitive advantage online.</p>

<p>Agile is challenging to use on certain projects, like those bound by fixed-price, fixed-date contracts. Agencies, governments, and other organizations who are bound by contracts struggle to implement Agile effectively. We&#39;ll explore ways that we can borrow the best processes from Agile when we&#39;re bound by the limitations of fixed-price contracts and statements of work.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re ready to proceed with a migration to Git, congratulations! You&#39;re about to start using one of the best development tools available. In this third part of the series we&#39;ll explore the actual migration and how it will impact your workflow in the future.</p>

<p>Joy isn&#39;t the typical emotion that comes to mind when one pictures enterprise software and enterprise software developers, but technical culture is changing rapidly and more people are recognizing the business value of joy.

<p class="uk-text-muted uk-text-small">2011-11-02</p>
<p>It was big news in 2010 when Twitter migrated their search from Ruby on Rails to Java-based Netty. Not only was it big in the news department, but it was also big in the results department: Twitter reported their search performance increased by 3x. In this post we&#39;ll explore Netty by using it to build a game of multiplayer tic-tac-toe.</p>

<p>A page I&#39;m working on accepts multiple image uploads. Once the images are successfully processed asynchronously on the server, an image panel on the same page is automatically refreshed. The AJAX callback works fine and updates the panel view with the newly uploaded photos, but the net result is that Fancybox stops working completely.</p>

<p>Java is a utilitarian, status-quo ecosystem for getting things done, albeit not very quickly. This is a good thing.

<p>A desire path represents the evolutionary nature of how people interact with their environment. An engineer designs a concrete path, but people find it more convenient to create their own. Software isn&#39;t any different. Users bump up against the limitation of an application but find their own workaround through sheer necessity.</p>
